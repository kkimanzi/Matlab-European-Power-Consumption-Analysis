# Matlab-European-Power-Consumption-Analysis
**Data**
The data selected for this task was that of “Western Europe Power Consumption”. The data was publically available and downloaded from Kaggle at the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francoisraucent/western-europe-power-consumption. The data obtained from the link was obtained from the ENTSO E-Transparency Platform, which provides access to such data as provided by various transmission system operators (TSOs) across Europe.
The data was time-series and had a resolution of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour depending on the country. The data spanned from January 2015 to August 2020. The units of measurement for the power consumption were in Megawatts (MW).
Multiple time-series spanning the same time period could be obtained by considering the power consumption of different countries in Western Europe. The data was also suitable since a single time series had thousands of values. Also, the data was relevant in the current space and the insights obtained from the data could be of importance.

**Research Questions**
•	How did power consumption in Britain, France, and Italy vary over time?
•	What is the yearly power consumption over the study time in Britain, France, and Italy?
•	What is the range of daily power consumption in Britain, France, and Italy?
